public class Encapsulation {
//    Encapsulation is defined as the wrapping up of data under a single unit. It is the
//    mechanism that binds together code and the data it manipulates. Another way to
//    think about encapsulation is, it is a protective shield that prevents the data from
//    being accessed by the code outside this shield.
//● Technically in encapsulation, the variables or data of a class is hidden
//            from any other class and can be accessed only through any member
//            function of its own class in which they are declared.
//            ● As in encapsulation, the data in a class is hidden from other classes using
//            the data hiding concept which is achieved by making the members or
//            methods of class as private and the class is exposed to the end user or
//            the world without providing any details behind implementation using the
//            abstraction concept, so it is also known as combination of data-hiding and
//    abstraction..


    //note - fraction class is the best example of the encapsulation
